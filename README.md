# Nez4Fun
Samples and demos games using MonoGame framework Nez as learning experience in game programming (and C#, in general). This repo is built against MonoGame 3.5.

Setup
----
- Pull a fresh copy of the Nez4Fun repository. The repository has the base Nez repository as a submodule so to fully download everything you need add the `--recursive` parameter when cloning:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/prime31/Nez-Samples.git`

- open Nez/Nez.sln and build that first

- now you can open the Nez4Fun.sln and run any of the projects in there

Demos
----
For now, only a simple Pong clone. In the future, I will add more samples or demos.
